======

Digital Micrograph plugin for intelligently archiving saved images based on tag information.

This plugin adds a small docked dialog which allows for easy access to changing the current Operator and Specimen information tags. Users can save there details into the dropdown so they don't need to re-enter them each time.

Each user can also set individual folder preferences so their images are automatically saved to the same directory when they select their profile.
Each user can also customise the order in which the directory structure is built up i.e Home\Specimen\Date\Area or Home\Date\Specimen\Area etc. and this is also saved with their profile.
